> All dependencies are managed using Vite and yarn, optimized for Chrome extension development.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version **22.x** or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (bundled with Node.js)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended for managing Node versions)

> You can install Node 22 via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with:
>
> ```bash
> nvm install 22
> ```

## 🧰 Setup & Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build the App Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

or use watch to automatically generate new build on update

```bash
npm run dev:watch
```

### 3. Load the Extension in Chrome

- Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`

- Enable Developer Mode

- Click on Load unpacked

- Select the `dist` folder from the project root

### 4. Local Development Tip

For local development I strongly suggest using using the `dev:watch`, to keep the dist folder up to date, with a addon like [Extensions Reloader ](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid) so you can quickly update the Galaxy Wallet with the new dist build files whenever you update the code.

## 📘 Usage Instructions

### 🧑‍🚀 First-Time Setup

1. **Launch Wallet** – Set a strong password
2. **Recovery Phrase** – Save your 12-word mnemonic securely
3. **Mnemonic Checkpoint** – Confirm selected words to proceed
4. **Galaxy Dashboard** – View address, balance and transactions

### 🔓 Unlocking Wallet

After being locked (manually or by timeout), the user must re-enter the password to unlock access.

### 🔐 Lock Wallet

Locking the wallet clears the session and requires password to re-enter. Trigger this from the side menu.

## 🧪 Testing

Core functionalities are covered with unit tests using **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)**.

### Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Test coverage includes:

- Wallet creation and encryption
- Password validation
- Balance formatting and fetching
- Date formatting
- Transaction history parsing and filtering
